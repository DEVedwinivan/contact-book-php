# Contact Book
The purpose of this project is to introduce us to the basics of PHP and strengthen our programming skills. It is not an extensive project, but it does seek to fulfill the objective of offering beginner programmers a practical guide for learning how to work with this language.

## Requirements
```
git clone https://github.com/DEVedwinivan/contact-book-php.git
```
I work with PHP using the Xampp package, which functions as a local server, but you can download the latest version of PHP from its official website. Select the version that is appropriate for your operating system. <br> You do not need any other requirements to run this project.
